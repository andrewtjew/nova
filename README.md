# Nova
## What is nova?
Nova is an opinionated service java framework. It's main goals are:
* Debuggablity as its highest priorty. A service must be debuggable not only during development. As such, there are no debug and release configurations. Nova provides tracing, logging and monitoring at all times. All its IO components provide a high amount of logging.
* Minimize development effort. Workflow integration in Java and IDE. A single developer should be able to develop a service using mostly Java, for example the bootstrap component allow the developer to generate dynamic Bootstrap web pages using java code. Deployment to cloud services can be done within the IDE.
* Low operational cost. Nova should not require additional monitoring and operational tools to be licensed and run.
